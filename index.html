    <h1>Dinosaurs</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade Dinosauria. They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago, although the exact origin
             and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic 
            extinction event 201 million years ago; their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.
        </p>
        <p>The fossil record shows that birds are feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier theropods during the Late Jurassic period. As such, birds were the only dinosaur
             lineage to survive the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event approximately 66 million years ago. Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs and the extinct non-avian
              dinosaurs, which are the focus of this article.

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>The taxon Dinosauria was formally named in 1842 by paleontologist Sir Richard Owen, who used it to refer to the distinct tribe or sub-order of Saurian Reptiles that were then being 
            recognized in England and around the world. The term is derived from the Greek words deinos, meaning "terrible, potent, or fearfully great", and sauros, 
            meaning "lizard or reptile". Though the taxonomic name has often been interpreted as a reference to dinosaurs' teeth, claws, and other fearsome characteristics, Owen intended it merely to evoke their size and majesty.

        <h2>Evolutionary history</h2>
        <p>Dinosaurs diverged from their archosaur ancestors during the Middle to Late Triassic period, roughly 20 million years after the devastating Permian–Triassic extinction event wiped out an estimated 96% of marine species
             and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species. Radiometric dating of fossil-bearing strata indicates that the oldest known dinosaur fossils are from Argentina and Brazil and are about 231.4 million years old.
        </p>
        <p>Dinosaurs may have appeared as early as the Anisian stage of the Triassic, roughly 245 million years ago, as indicated by remains from the Ischigualasto Formation of Argentina, but these are not universally regarded as 
            belonging to dinosaurs.
